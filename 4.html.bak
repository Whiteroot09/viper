				<h3>Computer network-</h3>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes.
						The computers use common communication protocols over digital
						interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical,
						and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
						The nodes of a computer network may include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, 	
						or other specialised or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses, 
						and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, 
						rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by 
						communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.
						Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, 
						including the transmission medium used to carry signals, 
						bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network 
						traffic, the network size, the topology, traffic control
						mechanism, and organizational intent.
						Computer networks support many applications and services,
						such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application
						and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging 
						applications.
						<img src="photo/computer.jpg" style="padding-left:2rem; float:right;">
					</p>
				<h3>Use-</h3>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, 
						such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. 
						A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by 
						devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. 
						A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to 
						access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing 
						resources across a network to accomplish tasks.
						<img src="photo/use.jpg" style="padding-right:2rem; float:left;">
					</p>
				<h3>Network packet-</h3>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. 
						A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.
						Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). 
						The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, 
						for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and 
						sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers 
						and trailers, with payload data in between.
						With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among 
						users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, 
						the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, 
						with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route 
						a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, 
						the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.
						The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets 
						to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before 
						it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.
					</p>
				<h3>Network topology-</h3>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect 
						on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput
						and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the 
						network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; 
						but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology 
						which is the map of logical interconnections of network hosts.
						<h2>Common layouts are:</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>					
									<li>
										<b>Bus network:</b> all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original 
										Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical 
										layer variants use point-to-point links instead, forming a star or a tree.
										<img src="photo/bus.png">
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Star network:</b> all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a small 
										switched Ethernet LAN, where each client connects to a central network switch, and logically in a wireless LAN, 
										where each wireless client associates with the central wireless access point.
										<img src="photo/star.png">
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Ring network:</b> each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and 
										that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. Token ring networks, and the 
										Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), made use of such a topology.
										<img src="photo/ring.png">
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Mesh network:</b> each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one 
										traversal from any node to any other.
										<img src="photo/mesh.png">
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Fully connected network:</b> each node is connected to every other node in the network.<br>
										<img src="photo/full.png">
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Tree network:</b> nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural topology for a larger Ethernet network with 
										multiple switches and without redundant meshing.
										<img src="photo/tree.png">
									</li>
								</ul>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								The physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. 
								As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, 
								because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. 
								Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can 
								represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.
							</p>
						<h2>Overlay network-</h2>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. 
								Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link 
								corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network.
								The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one.
								For example, many peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks.
								<img src="photo/over.png" style="float:right"> 
								They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.
								Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over
								telephone lines using modems before any data network existed.
								The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built 
								as an overlay on the telephone network. Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any 
								other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. Address 
								resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.
								Another example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, 
								the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a map) indexed by keys.
								Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through quality of service guarantees 
								achieve higher-quality streaming media. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and IP Multicast have not seen wide 
								acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network.[citation needed] On the other hand, an 
								overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from 
								Internet service providers. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between 
								two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches 
								its destination.
								For example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery 
								(a kind of multicast). Academic research includes end system multicast, resilient routing and quality of 
								service studies, among others.

				<h3>Network links-</h3>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the physical medium) used to link devices to form a 
						computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space. In the OSI model, the software to handle 
						the media is defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer.
						A widely adopted family that uses copper and fiber media in local area network (LAN) technology 
						are collectively known as Ethernet. The media and protocol standards that enable communication 
						between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3. Wireless LAN standards use radio waves, others 
						use infrared signals as a transmission medium. Power line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.
						<h2>Wired</h2>
							<p>
								The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.
								<ul>					
									<li>
										Coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. 
										Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.
										<img src="photo/coaxial.jpg">
									</li>
									<li>
										ITU-T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.
									</li>
									<li>
										Twisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized 
										for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. 
										The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded 
										twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios
										<img src="photo/twisted.jpg">
									</li>
									<li>
										An optical fiber is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of optical 
										fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical 
										fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be 
										sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea 
										cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF). 
										Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to 
										terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.
